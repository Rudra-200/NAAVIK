Navvik: Navigate India, the Indian Way
Welcome to Navvik, a groundbreaking India-centric navigation platform that redefines how travelers explore the vibrant tapestry of India’s roads, from festival-packed cities to serene rural paths. Powered by Bhuvan’s high-resolution geospatial data (Bhuvan Portal) and advanced Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs), Navvik delivers a culturally resonant, privacy-focused mapping experience tailored to India’s unique challenges.
Introduction
Navvik is more than a navigation tool—it’s a celebration of India’s diversity, designed to tackle the chaos of festival traffic, the intricacies of rural routes, and the need for sustainable travel. Unlike global solutions like Google Maps, Navvik prioritizes local nuances, offering features like festival-aware routing, detailed rural mapping, and multilingual support. With a commitment to data privacy and eco-friendly navigation, Navvik empowers users to journey with confidence, whether in bustling metros or remote villages.
Features
Core Functionalities

Festival-Aware Routing: Navigate around congestion during events like Diwali or Ganesh Chaturthi with real-time crowd data and alternate route suggestions.
Rural Mapping: Access high-resolution satellite imagery for remote areas, ensuring no path remains unmapped, unlike competitors’ limited rural coverage (India Today).
